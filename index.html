    <p>We Are Raising Disciples, Children with Values and Purpose
        At our orphanage, we believe every child was born with purpose. Though our children did not choose to be
        orphans, they are choosing to become disciples, strong, hopeful, and ready to change their history. We are not
        just providing shelter, but building a future through love, education, and the Word of God.
